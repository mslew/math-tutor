### Description
<p>This is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is hosted here: https://yellow-ocean-02e8fd010.1.azurestaticapps.net</p>
<p>We planned to create a fun math tutoring app for children to better practice their math skills. In order to make this fun and
enjoyable for children, we added a leveling system and a score system to better incentivize them. We believe that this project
delivered on the proposal. If we had more time, we would implement a timed game, a leaderboard, and more advanced math.</p>
